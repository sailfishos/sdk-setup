SHADOW BUILDS

CWD is used as a base dir for installroot/ and RPMS/ to allow for shadow
builds. Shadow builds can be done by passing project file or directory path to
the "build" or "qmake" (or "cmake") command:

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ mb2 build ../path/to/sources

    Or manually invoking each step:

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ mb2 qmake ../path/to/sources
    $ mb2 make
    $ mb2 package

Limitations related to shadow builds:

    1. Shadow build is only available for packages that use qmake (or CMake or
       GNU Automake).  Additionally, their build and install procedure must be
       fully realized using qmake (or CMake or GNU Automake) with no
       additional steps implemented at .spec level.
    2. The "--doprep" option to the "build" command cannot be used with shadow
       builds.
    3. If "prepare" or "apply" is needed, it must be used directly on the
       source tree prior to starting a shadow build (shadow builds for
       multiple targets are still possible provided that the %prep section is
       target-independent).
    4. GNU Automake, Autoconf and related tools, in case of packages that
       invoke these at build time, still store their outputs (Makefile.in,
       configure, etc.) under the source tree.


SHARED OUTPUT DIRECTORY

With shared output directory, it is possible to deploy all required packages
built from different sources more conveniently. This can be achieved with the
'--output-dir' option or even better with the combination of '--output-prefix'
and '--task' options.  Consider enabling '--output-prefix' and '--task' by
default by creating an alias in your '~/.mersdk.profile' to get build results
grouped by the tasks they are related to.  By default, the task will be
determined based on the current Git branch - check the '--task' option
description for more details:

    alias mb2='mb2 --output-prefix ~/RPMS --task'

    cd packageA
    git checkout -b bugXXXXX
    mb2 -t target build
    cd ../packageB
    git checkout -b bugXXXXX
    mb2 -t target build

    ls -1 ~/RPMS/bugXXXXX-my-target/
    mb2 -t target -d device deploy --manual --all \\
        && ssh device sudo zypper -p RPMS -v dup

With these options the output directory is also searched for build-time
dependencies by default, so if packageB requires packageA at build time, you
do not need to install packageA manually to the build target.

Note that it can be usefull to also pass '--from ~plus-repo-1' to 'zypper dup'.


CLEAN BUILDS

It is possible to avoid polluting build targets with build time dependencies
of a particular package by using the '--snapshot' option. With this option the
build target is not used directly. Instead a snapshot is taken and the build
is done using the snapshot of the build target. See '--snapshot' for details
on how the snapshot is chosen.

The snapshot will be reset automatically whenever the original build target is
updated, so if e.g. a locally built package is needed as a build-time
dependency, instead of installing it manually you should rely on the above
mentioned fact that with custom output directory the '--search-output-dir'
option is implied, and combine the '--snapshot' option with the
'--output-prefix' option.

For similar reasons, when mb2 fails to install build-time dependencies due to
errors like "file not found on the server", .i.e., because the local
repository cache got outdated, it is the original target that should be
updated, not the snapshot.

Consider enabling '--snapshot' by default as well:

    alias mb2='mb2 --output-prefix ~/RPMS --task --snapshot'

In order to ensure targets are not polluted by running mb2 without
'--snapshot' unintentionally, mb2 requires to use '--no-snapshot' explicitly
once at least one snapshot exists for a target.  Existing snapshots can be
listed and removed using 'sdk-assistant'.


QUALITY ASSURANCE

Certain quality checks may be performed with the help of the 'check' command:

    cd package
    mb2 build
    mb2 check

The command enables execution of (pluggable) test suites, each realizing
testing on one or more of the four recognized test levels:

    1. Static testing (verification) performed on the source tree

    2. Static testing (verification) performed on the build results (packages)

    3. Dynamic testing (validation) performed at build host (unit testing)

       Testing at this level is only supported with the built-in suite
       'rpmspec', that executes the steps defined by the '%check' section of
       the RPM .spec file if present.

       Testing at this level is normally performed by the 'build' and
       'package' commands (unless used with the '--no-check' option) and so it
       is not enabled by default for this command. Performed with this
       command, it involves execution of the 'make-install' command.

    4. Dynamic testing (validation) performed on a target device (system testing)

       The 'check' command does not include the deployment step. Package(s)
       need to be deployed to the device selected with the 'device'
       configuration option beforehand, possibly with the 'deploy' command in
       case of packages associated with the build tree under CWD.

The available test suites may be listed with the '--list-suites' option to the
'check' command.

See the 'check' command to learn how to override the default selection of test
levels, suites and artefacts.


MAINTAINING CHANGELOGS

If a file exists with '.changes' extension, otherwise matching the
spec file name, the effect will be the same as having a %changelog
section in the spec file.  If a file with '.changes.run' extension is
found instead, this file will be executed and its output treated as
the actual changelog.

COMMANDS
    build-requires [--[no-]refresh] {pull|reset}
        When 'pull' is used, install or update the build-time dependencies as
        is done implicitly by the 'prepare', 'build' and 'qmake' (or 'cmake')
        commands but refresh the package cache first, unless '--no-refresh' is
        active.

        When the global '--snapshot' option is used, '--no-refresh' is
        implied.  This can be overriden with '--refresh' - do not use unless
        you know what you are doing. If refresh is needed, refresh (and
        update) the original target instead.

        The 'reset' command can only be used together with the '--snapshot'
        global option, with the effect of reseting the target snapshot
        forcefully to the (possibly updated) state of the original target
        first, pulling later.

    prepare
        Run rpmbuild. Execute just the %prep section of the .spec file.

    apply [-R]
        Apply all patches defined in the .spec file to the source tree.

        -R    reverse apply patches (patch -R)

    build [-p|--prepare] [--no-check] [-d|--enable-debug] [-j <n>]
          [<project-dir-or-file>] [[--] <rpmbuild-extra-arg>...]
        Run rpmbuild. Execute all sections of the .spec file except for %prep
        unless told otherwise.

        If path to a <project-dir-or-file> is passed, shadow build will be
        done. Otherwise the current working directory is treated as the
        project directory. (The file name part is ignored - project file
        selection is done by qmake call inside the .spec file.)

        --prepare         Run %prep section as well
        --no-check        Skip the %check section
        --enable-debug    Enable debug build
        -j <n>            Run up to <n> jobs simultaneously

    qmake [<project-dir-or-file>] [[--] <qmake-extra-arg>...]
        Run rpmbuild. Execute just the %build section of the .spec file,
        suppressing any 'make' invocation figuring in that section.

        If path to a <project-dir-or-file> is passed, shadow build will be
        done. Otherwise the current working directory is treated as the
        project directory. (The file name part is ignored - project file
        selection is done by qmake call inside the .spec file.)

    cmake [<project-dir>] [[--] <cmake-extra-arg>...]
    cmake --build . [<cmake-extra-arg>...] [-- <build-tool-extra-arg>...]
        Run rpmbuild. Execute just the %build section of the .spec file,
        suppressing any 'cmake' invocation figuring in that section, that does
        not match the execution form used here, i.e., does not trigger the
        desired action, namely 1) generate a project buildsystem or
        2) build the project.

        Additionally, any plain 'make' invocation will be recognized as
        implementing the 'build the project' action and will be treated
        accordingly. Any possible <cmake-extra-arg> will be silently ignored
        and any possible <build-tools-extra-arg> will be used equally for
        each 'make' invocation in that case.

        If path to a <project-dir> is passed, shadow build will be done.
        Otherwise the current working directory is treated as the project
        directory.

    make [<make-extra-arg>...]
        Run rpmbuild. Execute just the %build section of the .spec file,
        suppressing any command figuring in that section, that is recognized
        as a command to generate project buildsystem. The following is a
        complete list of such commands:

        - any 'qmake' invocation
        - any 'cmake' invocation using the corresponding execution form

        For CMake based projects the 'make <make-extra-arg>...' command is
        equivalent to 'cmake --build . -- <make-extra-arg>...' (provided that
        'make' is the build tool used by the project).

    make-install
        Run rpmbuild. Execute just the %install section of the .spec file.

    package [--no-check]
        Run rpmbuild. Execute just the %install section of the .spec file, then
        build binary packages. Unless '--no-check' is passed, execute also the
        %check section if present.

    build-shell [<command> [<arg>...]]
        Execute an arbitrary <command> in the build environment.  If no
        <command> is specified, an interactive shell is opened.

    compiledb [<make-extra-arg>...]
        Run rpmbuild. Execute just the %build section of the .spec file,
        modifying any 'make' invocation figuring in that section in order to
        generate Clang's JSON Compilation Database file
        'compile_commands.json' as described below.

        Unless the (top-level) makefile defines a target named 'compiledb' or
        'compile_commands.json', 'make' will be wrapped with the 'compiledb'
        tool as the default option to generate the compilation database.

        A custom mechanism to generate the compilation database may be
        supplied by defining one of the above mentioned targets. In that case
        'make' will be invoked with command line modified by adding that
        target name and removing any other target-like argument. (Any
        non-option, non-assignment argument will be removed.  Options that
        accept arguments need to be sticked together with their arguments with
        '='.)

    check --list-suites
    check [-l|--levels [+|-]<level>...] [-s|--suites [+|-]<suite>...]
          [<artefact>...]
        Perform quality checks.

        By default, test suites operate on the artefacts associated with build
        tree under CWD. Alternatively, single path to a source tree and/or one
        or more package files may be specified as <artefact> on command line
        (build tree is always looked for under CWD).

        Each test suite realizes testing on one or more of the four recognized
        test levels. This is indicated in the output produced with the
        '--list-suites' option, using the keywords found in the first column
        of the following table.

        | Level          | Tested art. | Executed at   | Default |
        |----------------+-------------+---------------+---------|
        |    static      |             |               |         |
        | 1. ├── source  | Sources     | Build host    | +       |
        | 2. └── package | Packages    | Build host    | +       |
        |    dynamic     |             |               |         |
        | 3. ├── unit    | Build tree  | Build host    | -       |
        | 4. └── system  | Packages    | Target device | -       |

        (See also QUALITY ASSURANCE above.)

        -l, --levels [+|-]<level>...
            Select testing levels. Levels are selected using the keywords
            'source', 'package', 'static', 'unit', 'system' and 'dynamic' as
            described before. The default selection is indicated in the above
            table and can be overriden with the global option
            '--check-levels'.

        --list-suites
            List available test suites.

        -s, --suites [+|-]<suite>...
            Select test suites to use. By default all and only the essential
            suites are selected. See '--list-suites'. The default selection
            may be overriden with the global option '--check-suites'.

        The '--levels' and '--suites' options may be passed multiple values,
        separated with comma. If a name is prefixed with '+' or '-', the
        effect is cumulative and persists until overriden with later name
        prefixed with the opposite operator.

    deploy {--pkcon|--rsync|--sdk|--zypper|--manual} [--all] [--debug]
           [--] [[+|-]<pattern>...]
        Deploy build results to a device.

        By default, just the build results of the project under current working
        directory will be deployed. When a shared output directory is used (see
        '--output-dir' and '--output-prefix'), the option '--all' can be used to
        require deployment of all packages found under the output directory, no
        matter of their origin. The '--all' option is not available when the
        '--rsync' method is used.

        Selection of (sub)packages for deployment can be influenced with glob
        <pattern>s, each of which may be preceded with '+' or '-' to opt for
        either inclusion (default) or exclusion respectively as the desired
        effect. Later specified patterns may override earlier ones.  Extended,
        Bash-compatible patterns are allowed.  The '-*-debug@(info|source)'
        pattern is implied unless the '--debug' option is used.  Options must
        precede patterns if any.

        The following deployment methods are available, corresponding to the
        mandatory option:

        --pkcon
            Uses 'pkcon' to install RPM package(s). Requires the "Allow
            untrusted software" option enabled in Settings, does not require
            root access to the device.

        --rsync
            This method is special.  Uses 'rsync' to copy the installed files
            under '/opt/sdk/<name>' without building/installing RPM package(s).
            Does not require root access to the device.  Incompatible with
            '--all'.

        --sdk
            Uses the method native to the SDK to install RPM package(s).
            Requires developer mode enabled on the device, does not require
            root access.

        --zypper
            Uses 'zypper' to install RPM package(s).  Requires 'zypper'
            installed on the device, requires root access to the device.

        --manual
            Only transfers the RPM package(s) to the device for manual
            installation. Uses '~/RPMS' as the target directory on the device.

        When used via Qt Creator, this command implies also the "make-install"
        and "package" commands unless the '--all' option or '--rsync' method is
        used.

    undeploy {--sdk|--pkcon|--rpm|--rsync|--zypper} [--all] [-n|--dry-run]
             [--] [[+|-]<pattern>...]
        Undeploy build results previously deployed to a device.

        Initially, device packages are collected based on the build host name
        recorded in their metadata.  Just those packages that seem to
        originate from the host where mb2 is running will be considered for
        removal from the device.  For that it is vital that the host name is
        stable and unique among the host names recorded by packages installed
        from other sources.

        Further, unless the '--all' option is used, just the build results of
        the project under current working directory will be considered for
        removal from the device.  When the '--all' option is used, any build
        results originated from this build host will be considered.  (Note how
        the effect of '--all' differs between 'deploy' and 'undeploy'.)

        Package origin is determined based on the build host name recorded in
        its metadata.  For that it is vital that 1) the build host name has
        not changed since the time the packages were built and that 2) the
        build host name is unique among the host names recorded by packages
        installed from other sources.  See the 'engine' command to learn more
        about the build host name.

        With the '--dry-run' option, the list of (sub)packages that would be
        removed may be previewed without applying the changes.

        If needed, the selection can be furthermore adjusted with glob
        <pattern>s, each of which may be preceded with '+' or '-' to opt for
        either inclusion (default) or exclusion respectively as the desired
        effect.  Later specified patterns may override earlier ones.
        Extended, Bash-compatible patterns are allowed.  Options must precede
        patterns if any.

        Except for the '--rsync' method, the selected method is not required to
        match the method previously used with the 'deploy' command.

        The following methods of undeployment are available, corresponding to
        the mandatory option:

        --pkcon
            Uses 'pkcon' to remove RPM package(s).  Requires the "Allow
            untrusted software" option enabled in Settings, does not require
            root access to the device.

        --rpm
            Uses plain 'rpm' to remove RPM package(s).  Requires root access
            to the device.

        --rsync
            This method is special.  It does not work with RPM packages.  It
            is only capable to remove files previously copied under
            '/opt/sdk/' with 'deploy --rsync'.  With this method, the origin
            of the data is not taken into consideration.  Does not require
            root access to the device.

        --sdk
            Uses the method native to the SDK to remove RPM package(s).
            Requires developer mode enabled on the device, does not require
            root access. Not available with older devices.

        --zypper
            Uses 'zypper' to remove RPM package(s).  Requires 'zypper'
            installed on the device, requires root access to the device.

    run [<command> [<arg>...]]
        Run the given command on the device specified with '--device'.  Can be
        used for running gdb and a gdb server.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    The order of passing options matters. Options that occur later on the
    command line may override earlier options, including those implied by
    the earlier options.

    -i, --increment
        Increment release number in .spec file

    -t, --target <name>
        Specify the sb2 target to use

    -d, --device <name>
        Specify the device

    -o, --output-dir <dir>
        Defaults to './RPMS'. The resulting RPM packages will be placed
        directly under the specified <dir>. With this option existing files in
        the output directory are preserved.  Implies '--search-output-dir'

    -O, --output-prefix <dir>
        Much like '--output-dir' except that a subdirectory of the given <dir>
        will be used, denoted by the build target name (see '--target') and
        optionally prefixed with task name (see '--task') separated with
        single dash ('-') character ('<dir>/[<task>-]<target>').

    --search-output-dir[={verbose|quiet}]
        Consider the RPM packages found in the output directory when installing
        build time dependencies. The optional value controls zypper verbosity.
        The default is 'verbose'.

    --no-search-output-dir
        Override '--search-output-dir' option

    -s, --specfile <file>
        Specify the .spec file

    -S, --snapshot[=<suffix>]
        Avoid installing build-time dependencies to the sb2 target - use a
        snapshot of that target instead.

        The snapshot name will be determined by combining the original target
        name with the given <suffix>. Any occurence of '%{task}' within the
        <suffix> will be substituted with the name specified with the '--task'
        option or with an empty string if the '--task' option is not used.
        When no suffix was specified or when the substitution yields an empty
        string, a temporary snapshot will be used (these have ".mb2." followed
        by random character sequence in their names).

        Snapshot state is preserved across mb2 invocations unless the original
        target was updated meanwhile or it is a temporary snapshot that was
        previously used with different build tree, in which cases the snapshot
        will be reset. Snapshot can be reset forcefully using the
        'build-requires reset' command.

    --no-snapshot
        Force mb2 to directly use a target for which snapshots exist.

    -f, --shared-folder <dir>
        The folder where QtCreator shares devices.xml and ssh keys. This option
        is useful when the deploy command is used outside of virtual machine.

    -T, --task[=<name>|=git:<regex>]
        Modifies behavior of '--output-prefix' and '--snapshot' options.
        The task name can be specified either directly as <name> or it can be
        derived from the current Git branch name, using the POSIX extended
        regular expression <regex> both as a condition to enable this option
        and as a mean to select substring of the branch name to be used as
        the task name.  Defaults to '$DEF_TASK'.
        The default expression is suitable to look for a leading bug reference
        in the branch name.  E.g. 'bug1234' in 'bug1234-quickfix'.

    --no-task
        Override --task option

    --wrap <command>:<wrapper>
        Instruct rpmbuild to use the given <wrapper> as a replacement for the
        <command>. <command> must be a valid file name, without directory part
        while <wrapper> must be specified as an absolute file path.

    -x, --fix-version[=<tag>]
        This option is implied when used inside a Git working tree (use -X to
        override). When used via Qt Creator, it is only implied if the version
        recorded in the .spec file is exactly "0".

        With this option the version recorded in the .spec file will be
        ignored.  Instead, package version will be derived from the name of the
        latest tag in the current git branch or the selected tag <tag>.

        If the current HEAD, index or working tree differs from the tree
        denoted by the (latest or selected) tag, a suffix composed from the
        current branch name, time stamp and a commit SHA1 will be added to the
        package version. If git-state is not clean a git-stash will be created
        and its SHA1 will be used.

        It is recommended to store 'Version: 0' and 'Release: 1' in the .spec
        file when this option is to be used; as a sign that the version
        recorded there is not relevant.

    -X, --no-fix-version
        Override --fix-version option.

    -n, --no-pull-build-requires
        Do not update build-time dependencies unless required explicitly with
        'build-requires pull'.

    -c, --git-change-log[=<args>]
        Include change log generated from Git history with 'git-change-log'
        command, forwarding any <args>.  This option is not intended for
        regular use - create a script file named after the .spec file but with
        '.changes.run' extension to instruct $ME to generate changelog with
        'git-change-log <args>' instead.

    --check-levels [+|-]<level>...
        Override the default test levels the 'check' command operates on. See
        the '--levels' option to the 'check' command for more details.

    --check-suites [+|-]<suite>...
        Override the default test suites the 'check' command executes. See
        the '--suites' option to the 'check' command for more details.


KNOWN ISSUES

Build target snapshot is not reset automatically when the original target is
changed just by removing packages via plain RPM usage. Either use zypper for
all package operations or use 'mb2 build-requires reset' to ensure snapshot is
reset.
